    "text": "NOAA Fisheries’ Passive Acoustic Underwater Glider Field Comparison\nAs part of a strategic goal to invest in passive acoustic monitoring using gliders, NOAA Fisheries is pursuing field tests of several underwater gliders equipped with passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems during two 2-week ‘glider rodeos’ planned for the U.S. west coast and Hawaii in 2025-26.\nA pre-designed survey path will provide for resampling of the same area by each glider over each 2-week effort to maximize spatial and temporal overlap. Glider performance and acoustic recording and detection metrics will be measured for each system to enable comparison and inform future glider acquisitions and use by NOAA Fisheries.\nThis is a unique opportunity to examine the performance and capability of a diverse set of currently available PAM-equipped underwater gliders, and we welcome community input into test design and assessment metrics. Results will be made publicly available to inform future research and development.\nThere may be unfunded opportunities for participation to compare other systems, and we may be able to provide logistical support."

    "text": "During the glider rodeo, we will identify and define a series of metrics to be calculated for each platform. These metrics will provide a means of comparison to identify strengths and limitations, as well as ranges of performance. The metrics include (1) Operational metrics, (2) Passive acoustic metrics, and (3) Resource metrics.\nA preliminary set of metrics for each category are provided below. These are preliminary, and we welcome alternative definitions or calculations for each metric, as well as alternative metrics to consider.\nIf you have metrics you would like to recommend, please submit this via this google form (related references and citations are appreciated).\n[Insert Table of Survey Metrics]\n[Insert Table of Data Quality Metrics]\n[Inset Table of Acoustic Detection Metrics]"

In addition to comparing general system and sampling specifications, we have planned to assess a diverse set of survey, data quality, and acoustic detection metrics across each system Please follow this link to fill out our Google Form to include additional metrics (you can fill out form as many times as you like): Metrics Google Form Link\nDo you have data from other regions or systems that could contribute to our hardware comparison?\nAlthough we are focusing our field efforts on two regions, we are interested in collaborating to include data from other systems and areas if you have data you are willing to share."

    "text": "The primary contemporary gliders with PAM capacity include Slocum, Seagliders, Ocean Scout, and SeaExporer. We understand that technology is rapidly changing, and even if we are unable to directly include additional platforms, we hope to learn more about technologies currently in development. In addition, there may be (unfunded) opportunities for including alternative platforms within the Glider Rodeo effort (Please see section on ‘Inquiries’).\n\n\nNOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center began deploying Slocum gliders to study Antarctic krill in 2018, and in 2025 they will expand their glider program with PAM-equipped gliders to study marine mammals off the U.S. West coast. Slocum Gliders are modular, and two different PAM systems will be tested: the DMON (developed by WHOI) and WISPR (Embedded Ocean Systems).\n\n\n\nSeagliders are buoyancy driven autonomous underwater vehicles developed at the University of Washington. Through a partnership with Dave Mellinger at Oregon State University, NOAA researchers at Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center has been testing the passive acoustic capabilities of these gliders to conduct marine mammal monitoring off Hawaii. They will continue this collaboration in 2025 as PIFSC builds out their own glider lab with SeaGliders with onboard WISPR acoustic processors. Seaglider support resources can be found here, and WISPR 2.0 specifications can be found here. Note that WISPR 3.0 is under development.\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Scout is a small glider developed as a ‘user friendly’ PAM-equipped glider. They are much smaller and require less training and expertise to use. Southwest Fisheries Science Center has procured two Ocean Scouts for testing and for specific scientific research efforts. The Ocean Scout specifications can be found here.\n\n\n\nThe SeaExplorer was developed by the French company Alcen-Alseamar. Alseamar SeaExplorers are not yet available for purchase in the United States, but the company offers their gliders as a service, with mission planning, piloting, and data delivery. We will include SeaExplorers in our Glider Rodeo (as a service). SeaExplorer specifications can be found here.\n\n\n\nWe understand that these technologies are rapidly developing, and we’d love to hear about new developments. Please contact us under the ‘Inquiries’ page."
