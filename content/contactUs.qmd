*Instructions for submitting submitting an inquiry will be added soon!* --\> Give instructions for submitting an inquiry through the Github Issues

**Do you have an acoustic glider system youâ€™d like to test as part of this effort?**


*We cannot currently offer funding to participate, but may be able to provide logistic support- lab space for preparation, vessels for glider deployment and/or recoveries, if associated with our efforts.*



**Do you have suggestions for metrics that would help evaluate PAM-equipped glider options?**
*In addition to comparing general system and sampling specifications, we have planned to assess a diverse set of survey, data quality, and acoustic detection metrics across each system*
Please follow this link to fill out our Google Form to include additional metrics (you can fill out form as many times as you like): [Metrics Google Form Link](https://forms.gle/tYZY8YjMZH11QhiA6){target="_blank"}



**Do you have data from other regions or systems that could contribute to our hardware comparison?**

*Although we are focusing our field efforts on two regions, we are interested in collaborating to include data from other systems and areas if you have data you are willing to share.*
