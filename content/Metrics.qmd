title: Metrics 
---

During the glider rodeo, we will identify and define a series of metrics to be calculated for each platform. These metrics will provide a means of comparison to identify strengths and limitations, as well as ranges of performance. The metrics include (1) Operational metrics, (2) Passive acoustic metrics, and (3) Resource metrics.

A preliminary set of metrics for each category are provided below. These are preliminary, and we welcome alternative definitions or calculations for each metric, as well as alternative metrics to consider.

If you have metrics you would like to recommend, please submit this via this [google form](https://forms.gle/tYZY8YjMZH11QhiA6){target="_blank"} (related references and citations are appreciated).
