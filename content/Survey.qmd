NMFS is pursuing tests of several passive acoustic equipped underwater
gliders as part of its Uncrewed Systems Strategic Initiative, funded by
the Inflation Reduction Act.

-   NMFS will be carrying out performance testing across glider systems
    during two 2-week ‘glider rodeos’ planned for the U.S. west coast
    and Hawaii in 2025-26.

-   NMFS-funded testing will include Slocum, Seaglider, OceanScout
    (Hefring) and SeaExplorer (Alseamar) platforms with DMONS2, WISPR,
    and Alseamar’s acoustic acquisition systems.

-   A pre-designed survey path will provide for resampling of the same
    area by each glider platform over the 2 week effort. Glider
    performance and acoustic detection metrics will be measured for each
    system to enable comparison and inform future glider acquisitions
    and use by NMFS.
